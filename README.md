# Code for Bachelor's Thesis: Dark Energy: Constraining Cosmological Models with Extra Spatial Dimensions Based on Type Ia Supernovae Data
This is the repository where the code used for my bachelor's thesis can be viewed. 
The code used in the thesis was created with help of chatgpt.com (Model 4o mini) and perplexity.ai (Model Pro). The use of AI only took place with independent reflection on the content provided and was carefully checked for accuracy. For loading and reading the data, a code of Martin Kerscher was used.

The data files are from: https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease
specifically see:
--> Pantheon+_Data --> 4_DISTANCES_AND_COVAR

### Project structure:
In the Jupyter Notebooks thesis_code_CDM.ipynb and thesis_code_DGP.ipynb all codes for the plots are shown - grouped by the corresponding models.
The files are each structured by:
- Fitting the data
- Contour Plots
- MCMC Contour Plots

The code comments are in German as this is my mother tongue - nevertheless, the code should be understandably structured and thus readable for everyone.

### Disclaimer:
This code has been restructured and consolidated from multiple Jupyter Notebook cells. 
While care was taken to preserve the logical flow and correctness, the full pipeline has not been re-executed due to the computational cost of the calculations. 
As such, there might be minor inconsistencies or missing intermediate results that would normally be generated during runtime.
