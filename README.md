# Constraining_cosm_models_thesis
This is the repository where the code used for my bachelor's thesis can be viewed. The code used in the thesis was created with help of chatgpt.com (Model 4o mini) and perplexity.ai (Model Pro). . The use of AI only took place with inde- pendent reflection on the content provided and was carefully checked for accuracy.
